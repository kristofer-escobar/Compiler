	Huh?  Take a breath.  Here we go:
	- The "|" separates this into two expressions, as in A or B.
	- "^\s+" matches a sequence of one or more whitespace characters at the beginning of a string.
    - "\s+$" is the same thing, but at the end of the string.
    - "g" makes is global, so we get all the whitespace.
    - "" is nothing, which is what we replace the whitespace with.
